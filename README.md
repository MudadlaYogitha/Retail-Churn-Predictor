# Retail-Churn-Predictor
This project analyzes customer churn in retail using data analytics and machine learning. It includes data preprocessing, trend analysis, and predictive modeling to identify at-risk customers. The well-documented, modular notebook provides actionable insights to enhance retention strategies.

This project explores customer churn in the retail industry using a structured data analytics and machine learning approach. The Jupyter Notebook included in this repository is designed to process raw retail data, transform it into a clean and usable format, and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover meaningful patterns and trends.

Key features of the project include advanced data preprocessing techniques to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables, along with detailed visualizations to better understand customer behavior. The core component is a machine learning model trained to predict the likelihood of customer churn, enabling businesses to proactively identify at-risk customers and implement strategies to improve retention.

The notebook is modular and well-documented, making it easy to follow and adapt to various datasets. The project combines technical simplicity with practical insights, providing a valuable resource for retail analysts, data scientists, and business professionals aiming to address customer retention challenges effectively.

This repository is a great starting point for anyone looking to apply machine learning in retail analytics or enhance their skills in predictive modeling and data visualization.
